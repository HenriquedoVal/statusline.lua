Originally a fork from [beauwilliams/statusline.lua](https://github.com/beauwilliams/statusline.lua)
(thank you very much) but I made too many changes.  

Changes:  

- Complete move to lua
- Dropped support for optional dependencies
- Dropped config
- Better load time
- tabline now shows current buffers
- smoother lsp messages display
